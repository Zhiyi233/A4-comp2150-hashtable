Assignment 4

How to compile and run my code: 
1. node main.js

Then the hamlet.txt.huff file will automaticlly be produced.

How to run the test code for Dictionary:
1. node testFile.js

Then the output of testing times and how many time the test failed or succeed will be shown.

Even if I tried my best to do this Assignment, I still did not figure out how to do the correct encoding for encode(), so I produced an extra txt
file for you to have a better checking.( All the things in the output.txt is the characters and their weights for all the tree at the beginning 
of encoding).
